# Concepts Of Programming - TermProject
The following problem has been solved using two different languages: JavaScript and Kotlin.

Given a string s and an integer array indices of the same length.
The string s will be shuffled such that the character at the i position moves to indices[i] in the shuffled string.
Return the shuffled string.
Example:
Input: s = "art", indices = [1,0,2]
Output: "rat"
